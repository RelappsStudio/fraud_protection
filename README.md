# Fraud Protection

A **Flutter plugin** providing runtime security protections for Android applications against common fraud, abuse, and malicious accessibility practices.  

This package helps developers protect their users by detecting **abusive accessibility services**, **user touches coming through overlays** and other suspicious behaviors.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Device Security Checks**
  - Detect if **Device Administrator apps** are active.
  - Detect if **Developer Mode** (or otherwise ADB/USB/WiFi debugging) is enabled.

- **Overlay Protections**
  - Block or hide malicious overlay windows.
  - Detect **obscured or partially obscured touches** (clickjacking/tapjacking defense).

- **Accessibility Monitoring**
  - Get a list of all active accessibility services.
  - Verify that **only whitelisted accessibility services** are active.
  - Detect if **any blacklisted accessibility services** are active (supports wildcards).

- **Event Streams**
  - Stream **touch events**. Monitor if your users interact with the app through a partial or full-screen overlay.
  - Maybe more to come if I figure out screenshot & screen recording detection properly

## üìñ Usage

See example for the fullest usage, including recommended one with LifecycleObserver.

### Device Security

```dart
final isAdminAppPresent = await FraudProtection.isDeviceAdminActive();
final isDevMode = await FraudProtection.isDeveloperModeEnabled();
```

### Overlay Protection

You can enable and disable these protections dynamically during runtime by passing true/false from anywhere in your app.

```dart
// Hide malicious overlay windows (Android 12+)
// Forces your application on top of any potential overlay
await FraudProtection.setHideOverlayWindows(true);

// Block touches if app is obscured by overlays
await FraudProtection.setBlockOverlayTouches(true);
```
#### Small caveat to overlays
Android OS treats active accessibility service overlay differently than a regular overlay coming from an app. This means that **there is no way of protection against overlay malware with active accessibility service**. That's why the next section is most important.
### Accessibility Checks

Get all active accessibility services
```dart
// Returns List<String>
final activeServices = await FraudProtection.getActiveAccessibilityServices();
```
Ensure only whitelisted services are active
```dart

// Accepts only full name package id + service name
// Returns bool
final safe = await FraudProtection.areAllAccessibilityServicesWhitelisted([
 "com.android.talkback/.TalkBackService",
  "com.google.android.marvin.talkback/.TalkBackService",
  "com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess/.VoiceAccessService",
]);
```
Detect if any blacklisted services are active
```dart
// Since malware is more tricky accepts wildcards with *
// It's enough to know full or partial package name
// Returns bool
final unsafe = await FraudProtection.isAnyAccessibilityServiceBlacklisted([
  "com.malware.*",
  "com.fakebank.*",
]);
```
You can use pre-screened blacklist with known malware
```dart
// You can expand it with your own packages
// It is appreciated to make PR to package repo to add your package to baseline.
 await FraudProtection.isAnyAccessibilityServiceBlacklisted(
  FraudProtection.DEFAULT_ACCESSIBILITY_BLACKLIST + [] );
```

### Event Streams

```dart
FraudProtection.touchEvents.listen((event) {
  // Handle obscured touch event
  print("Touch event detected: $event");
});
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Screenshot and Screen Recording detection** are currently not exposed for usage:
  - Android does not reliably notify apps when the screen is captured by another app.
- This package is **Android-only**. iOS support is not currently available.
- Accessibility whitelisting/blacklisting is best-effort; **wildcards only support prefix matches**.

---

## üìå Supported Platforms

- ‚úÖ Android  
- ‚ùå iOS (planned) but to my knowledge these problems don't really apply there

---

## üîí Security Considerations

This plugin should be used as part of a **multi-layer security strategy**.  
It **does not guarantee complete protection** against advanced attacks.  
Always combine with:
- Server-side fraud detection
- Obfuscation and tamper checks
- Proper authentication and authorization controls
- Preferably a 3rd party solution like:
    - Android Integrity API
    - Threatmark
    - Appdome
    - etc
